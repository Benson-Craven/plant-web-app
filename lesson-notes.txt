Overview

1. Fetch data on the server using server components
2. Fetch data in parallel to minimise waterfalls and reduce loading times
3. For layouts and pages, fetch data where it's used. Next.js will automatically dedupe requests in a tree
4. Use Loading UI, Streaming and Suspense to progressiovely render a page and show a result to the user while the rest of the content loads

Next.js tends to recommend SSG where possible.

Using not-found.tsx is a assigned name for a page that will throw a 404 error to the user, this can also be modified.
